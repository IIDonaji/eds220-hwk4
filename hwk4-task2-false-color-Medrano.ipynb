    "## About \n",
    "In this notebook we will look at fire scars through false color imagery from satellite data like Landsat. Here we will creat a false color imagery of the Eaton and Palisades Fires and assigning infrared band to visible colors to higlight burn severity and the extend of fire scars. False color imagery is a useful tool for monitoring wildlife impacts and assists land managers and researcher asses recovery efforts and plan resotration strategies. \n",
